to Wilum from Jessica

To exist in this world is no fun for me and I would
Rather fall into a deep black pit where there are no
Answers because there are no questions and
No purpose whatsoever and therefore no reason to
Struggle for a purpose or a rhyme or a
Meaning to existence when there is none, none, none,
Other than to dream of blind bliss…but O
God, I am already here.
